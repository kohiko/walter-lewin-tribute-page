      <h1><strong>Biography</strong></h1>
      <article id="bio">
        <p> Walter Hendrik Gustav Lewin (born on January 29, 1936)  is a Dutch astrophysicist and former professor
      of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Lewin earned his doctorate in nuclear physics
      n 1965 at the Delft University of Technology and was a member of MIT's physics faculty for 43 years beginning
      in 1966 until his retirement in 2009.</p>

        <p> Lewin's contributions in astrophysics include the first discovery of a rotating neutron star through
       all-sky balloon surveys and research in X-ray detection in investigations through satellites and
       observatories. He has received various awards for teaching in his lectures in physics and their
       publication online via Youtube, edX, and MITOpenCourseWare.</p>

        <p> In December 2014, MIT revoked Lewin's Professor Emeritus title after an MIT investigation determined
       that Lewin had violated university policy by sexually harassing an online student in an online MITx course
       he taught in fall 2013. Moreover, his online videos on edX and Youtube were taken down upon being revoked.</p>

        <p> Despite this, Lewin was able to reupload his lectures through his own channel
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiEHVhv0SBMpP75JbzJShqw" target="_blank">  "Lectures by Walter Lewin.
        They will make you â™¥ Physics."</a> which has over 600k subscribers. Currently, Lewin has been uploading videos
        until now inspiring and giving challenges to viewers who have interests in Physics.</p>

          <p>Physics I is a first-year physics course which introduces students
            to classical mechanics. This course has a hands-on focus, and approaches mechanics
            through take-home experiments. Topics include: kinematics, Newton's laws of motion,
            universal gravitation, statics, conservation laws, energy, work,
            momentum, and special relativity.</p> </div>

        <p>Physics II course is an introduction to electromagnetism and electrostatics.
          Topics include: electric charge, Coulomb's law, electric structure of matter,
          conductors and dielectrics, concepts of electrostatic field and potential,
          electrostatic energy, electric currents, magnetic fields, Ampere's law, magnetic materials,
          time-varying fields, Faraday's law of induction, basic electric circuits, electromagnetic waves,
          and Maxwell's equations. The course has an experimental focus, and includes several experiments that are
          intended to illustrate the concepts being studied.</p>
